## Introduction

**Finbro** is a simple and efficient personal finance tracker that helps users record, manage, and monitor their
expenses. It allows you to keep track of spending, set financial limits, and convert expenses into different currencies
for better financial awareness.

---

## Quick Start

1. Ensure that you have Java 17 or above installed.
2. Download the latest version of `Finbro` from the provided release link.
3. Open a terminal in the folder containing the `.jar` file. Run the application using:

   `java -jar Finbro.jar`

4. Start entering commands to manage your expenses.
5. Finbro automatically saves your data to `./data/finbro.txt` so it can be loaded the next time you run the app.
   - The first line stores your spending limit in the format: `LIMIT | <amount>`
   - Each subsequent line stores one expense in the format: `<amount> | <category> | <date>`
   - Do not edit `./data/finbro.txt` manually. Changing symbols (especially `|`), order, or date/number formats can corrupt the file and may cause Finbro to load incorrectly or fail to load your entries.

---

The system will ask you for:

1. **Expense Amount**
   - The application will prompt: `What is the expense amount?`
   - Enter `-exit` to cancel adding an expense in walkthrough mode.
   - Enter the amount you spent.
   - The amount must be a positive number greater than 0.
   - The value will be rounded to 2 decimal places.
   - A confirmation will be required if the amount exceeds `10,000`.
   - Examples: `50.00`, `25`
2. **Expense Category**
   - The application will prompt: `Enter the category:`
   - Enter the expense category.

   - Enter `-exit` to cancel adding an expense in walkthrough mode.
   - Enter `-back` to re-enter the amount.

3. **Expense Date**
   - The application will prompt: `Enter the date (yyyy-MM-dd or today):`
   - Enter the date of the expense.
   - The date must be in the past between year 2000 and current (future dates are not allowed).
   - You can enter either a full date (e.g., `2026-04-12`) or one of these natural language formats:
     - `today`, `yesterday`
     - `last week`
     - `<N> day(s) ago` (e.g., `2 days ago`)
     - `<N> week(s) ago` (e.g., `3 weeks ago`)
     - `last <day-of-week>` (e.g., `last monday`)
   - Note: inputs like `tomorrow`, `next week`, `next monday`, and `<N> days later` may be understood, but will be rejected for `add` because future dates are not allowed.
   - Use the format shown above.

## Delete Expense Command

The `delete` command lets you remove an existing expense. Similar to the `add` command, it supports both direct mode and walkthrough mode.

### Direct Mode

**Use this when you know exactly what you want to remove:**

```
delete <category> <index>
```

**Required Information:**

| Field        | Format           | Example     |
| ------------ | ---------------- | ----------- |
| **category** | Text (no spaces) | `Groceries` |
| **Index**    | Positive Number  | 1           |


**Example:**

```
delete food 1
```

### Walkthrough Mode

**Use this when you want the system to guide you:**

Simply type:

```
delete
```

The system will guide you through the deletion process step by step:

1. **Category**
   - Enter the category of the expense you want to delete
   - The category must already exist
   - Type `-l` to display all existing category names
   - Type `-exit` to cancel the delete operation

2. **Expense Number**
   - Enter the index number of the expense in that category
   - The number must be a positive integer within the valid range
   - Type `-l` to display all expenses under the selected category

   - Type `-exit` to cancel the delete operation

3. **Confirmation**
   - Review the expense to be deleted
   - Type `yes` or `y` to confirm deletion
   - Any other input cancels the deletion

## View Expenses

The `view` command lets you display your recorded expenses in different ways.
You can view all expenses, view a specific category, or optionally sort and filter the results with `-sort` and `-filter`.

### Command Format

`view all` — displays all recorded expenses

`view all -sort <year|month|category|amount>` — displays all expenses sorted by the chosen option

`view <category>` — displays expenses under a specific category

`view <category> -filter <month>` — displays only the expenses in that category for the given month

`view <category> -sort <year|month|amount>` — displays that category sorted by the chosen option

`view <category> -filter <month> -sort <year|month|amount>` — filters the category by month first, then sorts the result

### How it works

- `view all` shows every recorded expense.
- `view all` can be sorted with `-sort year`, `-sort month`, `-sort category`, or `-sort amount`.
- `view <category>` shows only expenses that match the category name.
- `view <category>` can be filtered by month with `-filter <month>`.
- `-filter` is case-insensitive, so `january`, `January`, and `JANUARY` are treated the same.
- `view <category>` can also be sorted with `-sort year`, `-sort month` or `-sort amount`.
- You can use `-filter` and `-sort` together, and the order of the flags does not matter.
- `-sort category` is only supported with `view all`.
- `-filter` only works with `view <category>`.

### Examples

**Example 1: Viewing all expenses**

`view all`

Expected output:

```
Here are your expenses:

1.  Amount: $50.00
    Category: food
    Date: 2026-03-01

2.  Amount: $20.00
    Category: transport
    Date: 2026-03-02

Total expenditure: $70.00
```

**Example 2: Viewing expenses under the `food` category**

`view food`:

Expected output:

```
Here are your expenses:

1.  Amount: $50.00
    Category: food
    Date: 2026-03-01

Total expenditure: $50.00
```

**Example 3: Viewing all expenses sorted by amount**

`view all -sort amount`

Expected output:

```
Here are your expenses:

1.  Amount: $50.00
    Category: food
    Date: 2026-03-01

2.  Amount: $20.00
    Category: transport
    Date: 2026-03-02

Total expenditure: $70.00
```

**Example 4: Viewing expenses by category and filtering by month**

`view transport -filter march`

Expected output:

```
Here are your expenses:

1.  Amount: $50.00
    Category: transport
    Date: 2026-03-01

Total expenditure: $50.00
```

**Example 5: Viewing expenses by category, filtering by month, and sorting by amount**

`view transport -filter march -sort amount`

Expected output:

```
Here are your expenses:

1.  Amount: $50.00
    Category: transport
    Date: 2026-03-01

2.  Amount: $20.00
    Category: transport
    Date: 2026-03-12

Total expenditure: $70.00
```

### Notes

- The categories are NOT case-sensitive so you can write `view Food` or `view food` to get the same output.
- The month used with `-filter` is also case-insensitive, so `view transport -filter JANUARY` works.
- `-filter` only accepts a month name, such as `January`.
- If no expenses exist under the specified category, an error message will be shown.
- Running `view` without any argument will display an error message prompting the correct format
- Each flag may appear at most once.

---

## Setting the spending limit: `limit`

Allows you to set a new monthly spending limit.

**Format** `limit <amount>`

- Amount must be a numeric input
- Amount must be non-negative
- System will prompt for a confirmation message - "yes"
- Limit will be saved on disk between Finbro sessions

**Example:** `limit 100`

Output:

```
Are you sure you want to change your monthly budget limit to $100.00? [yes/no]
yes
--------------------------------------------------
Monthly budget limit: $100.00
--------------------------------------------------
```

---

## Viewing the spending limit: `limit`

Allows you to view your current monthly spending limit.

**Format** `limit`

- `limit` must take no arguments

**Example:** `limit`
Output:
```
--------------------------------------------------
Monthly budget limit: $100.00
--------------------------------------------------
```

---

## Editing the spending limit

Allows you to modify your current monthly spending limit by increasing, decreasing, or replacing it.

Simply type:

```
edit limit
```

### Description

When this command is executed, the system will display your current monthly budget limit and prompt you to choose one of the
following options by keying in the option number:

1. Increase limit
2. Decrease limit
3. Replace limit

After selecting an option, you will be prompted to enter the amount for the chosen operation.  
You will then be asked to confirm the change before the new limit is applied.

### Behaviour

- **Increase limit**
  - Adds the entered amount to the current limit.
- **Decrease limit**
  - Subtracts the entered amount from the current limit.
  - The resulting limit **must not be negative**.
- **Replace limit**
  - Sets the current limit to a new value.
- All inputs must be **valid non-negative numbers**.
- The system will reject invalid menu selections or invalid numeric inputs.

- For **Increase** / **Decrease**, the amount must be a **non-negative number**.
  - Do not include a sign (e.g. use `5`, not `-5` or `+5`).
  - If you enter a leading `+` (e.g. `+5`), Finbro will treat it as `5`.

### Examples

**Example 1: Increase your limit**

Input:

```
edit limit
1
25
yes
```

Output:

```
--------------------------------------------------
edit limit
--------------------------------------------------
Current monthly budget limit: $100.00

### Common Issues

**Issue: Entering an invalid option (not 1, 2, or 3)**

If you enter an option outside `1`, `2`, or `3`, Finbro will show a warning and display the menu again.

**Issue: Entering a negative amount**

If you enter a negative amount, Finbro will show an error and exit the `edit limit` flow. Run `edit limit` again to retry.

**Issue: Leaving the amount blank (pressing Enter)**

If you do not enter anything when asked for an amount, Finbro will show an error and exit the `edit limit` flow. Run `edit limit` again to retry.

---

## Budget Reminder System

Finbro includes a budget reminder system that alerts you when your total expenses exceed your set monthly limit,
or is close to exceeding the limit.  
When you add a new expense, the system will check if the total expenditure for the current month differs by $20
or below with the limit, or exceeds the limit.
If it does, a warning message will be displayed to inform you that you are close to exceeding your monthly budget,
or have exceeded your budget for the month.

### Examples

**Example 1: Close to limit warning**
Suppose your monthly spending limit is set to \$100.00, and your total expenses for the current month have reached
\$85.00. The system will check the total expenditure (\$85.00) against the limit (\$100.00), and constantly prompt you
with the following warning message until you add more expenses or edit your limit:

```
Warning: You are close to your monthly spending limit of $100.00!
```

**Example 2: Exceeded limit warning**
Suppose your monthly spending limit is set to \$100.00, and your total expenses for the current month have reached
\$120.00. The system will check the total expenditure (\$120.00) against the limit (\$100.00), and constantly prompt
you with the following warning message until you add more expenses or edit your limit:

```
Warning: You have exceeded your monthly spending limit of $100.00!
```

## Converting expense currency

Allows you to convert an existing expense into another currency using predefined exchange rates.

**Use this when you want the system to guide you through a currency conversion:**

You must already have at least one recorded expense before using this command.

Simply type:

```
currency
```

The system will ask you for:

1. **Source Currency**
   - The application will prompt: `Enter source currency:`
   - Enter the original currency of the selected expense amount.
   - Currency codes are case-insensitive and will be converted to uppercase internally.
   - If the source currency or target is unsupported, Finbro will immediately show an error and stop the command.
   - Examples: `SGD`, `usd`, `EUR`

2. **Target Currency**
   - The application will prompt: `Enter target currency:`
   - Enter the currency you want to convert the expense into.
   - The source and target currencies must be supported by Finbro.
   - Examples: `USD`, `JPY`, `MYR`

3. **Expense Entry**
   - Finbro will display your recorded expenses after both currencies are entered.
   - The application will prompt: `Which expense entry would you like to convert?`
   - Enter the index number of the expense you want to convert.
   - The index must be a valid number within the displayed list.

### Behaviour

- Uses a **local currency rate table** (no internet connection required).
- Supports the following currencies: `SGD`, `USD`, `EUR`, `GBP`, `JPY`, `CNY`, `AUD`, `CAD`, `MYR`, `HKD`, `KRW`.
- You must have at least one recorded expense before conversion can begin.
- The selected expense must exist in the displayed list.
- The converted value is displayed but does not modify the original expense.
- If the source and target currencies are the same and both are supported, Finbro will tell you that no conversion is needed.

### Examples

**Example 1: Convert an expense from SGD to USD**

Input:

```
currency
SGD
USD
1
```

Output:

```
--------------------------------------------------
currency
--------------------------------------------------
Enter source currency:
SGD
Enter target currency:
USD
--------------------------------------------------
Here are your expenses:

1. Amount: $10.00
   Category: food
   Date: 1 January 2026

2. Amount: $20.00
   Category: transport
   Date: 2 January 2026

Total expenditure: $30.00
--------------------------------------------------
Which expense entry would you like to convert?
--------------------------------------------------
1
--------------------------------------------------
Expense #1
10.00 SGD = 7.40 USD
--------------------------------------------------
```

**Example 2: Source and target currencies are the same**

Input:

```
currency
USD
USD
```

Output:

```
--------------------------------------------------
currency
--------------------------------------------------
Enter source currency:
USD
Enter target currency:
USD
--------------------------------------------------
Source and target currencies are both USD. No conversion needed.
--------------------------------------------------
```

**Example 3: Convert an expense from USD to CNY**

Input:

```
currency
USD
CNY
2
```

Output:

```
--------------------------------------------------
currency
--------------------------------------------------
Enter source currency:
USD
Enter target currency:
CNY
--------------------------------------------------
Here are your expenses:

1. Amount: $10.00
   Category: food
   Date: 1 January 2026

2. Amount: $20.00
   Category: transport
   Date: 2 January 2026

Total expenditure: $30.00
--------------------------------------------------
Which expense entry would you like to convert?
--------------------------------------------------
2
--------------------------------------------------
Expense #2
20.00 USD = 143.40 CNY
--------------------------------------------------
```

### Common Issues

**Issue: Entering an unsupported currency**

If you enter a currency code that Finbro does not support, Finbro will show an error message with the list of supported currencies.
If the invalid input is entered as the source currency, Finbro will stop immediately without asking for the target currency.
This check happens even if the source and target inputs are identical, so inputs such as `ABC` and `ABC` will still be rejected.

**Issue: Entering an invalid expense index**

If you enter a non-numeric index or a number outside the displayed list, Finbro will show an error and the conversion will not proceed.

**Issue: Converted values do not match live exchange rates**

Finbro uses **offline, locally stored conversion rates** for the `currency` command. The converted amount is meant for quick reference and may differ from real-time market exchange rates.

## FAQ

**Q**: Can I cancel the `edit limit` operation after entering the amount?  
**A**: Yes. After entering the amount, you will be asked to confirm the change. Enter `no` to cancel and keep your
current limit unchanged.

---

**Q**: Do currency conversions update my stored expenses?  
**A**: No. The `currency` command only displays the converted value. Your original expense remains unchanged.

---

**Q**: Why are the currency rates different from real-world rates?  
**A**: Finbro uses a local predefined rate table and does not fetch live exchange rates.

---

**Q**: What should I do if my currency is not supported?  
**A**: Use one of the supported currencies listed in the error message when prompted.
